# Manage branch
The management of the branch is the most important part of the git. And git can switch the branch quickly, and the branch is very light, so it is very convenient to use the branch to manage the project.

## 4.1 create and merge branch
As we all know, git will string every commit together into a timeline, and the timeline is a branch. As so far, only one branch in the git, which is the main branch, that is `master`. 
But strictly speaking, `HEAD` does not refer to directional submission, but to 'master'. 'master' refers to submission, so 'HEAD' refers to the current branch.
- At the beginning, the `master` branch is a line, and git use the `master` refer to the latest commit, then use `HEAD` refer to the `master`, and you can confirm current branch and the commint point of current branch.
